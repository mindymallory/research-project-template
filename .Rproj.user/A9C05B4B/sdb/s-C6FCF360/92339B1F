The fundamental\nidea of reproducible research is that the steps that take your research\nfrom raw data to manuscript, thesis, or report should be fully\nautomated. This way, your work can be checked by your adviser, mentors,\ncollaborators, others working in your area, journal reviewers, and your\nfuture self.\n\nR and RStudio are an excellent vehicle for conducting reproducible\nresearch. You write manuscripts and reports in `.rmarkdown` documents\nthat includes code chunks that perform analysis. The code chunks are\nevaluated by `R` and incorporated in the document by the tools in the\n`knitr` package to produce a markdown `.md` document. From there a\nprogram called `pandoc` converts your markdown document to whatever file\nformat you like: PDF (formatted with latex .csl files), html, or\nMicrosoft Word. This all happens without the user really knowing what is\ngoing on, which makes it easy to get started.\n\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n\n[Introduction to R](/research-project-template/intro-to-r)  \n[Getting Started](/research-project-template/getting-started)  \n[Data](/research-project-template/data-raw)  \n[Analysis](/research-project-template/analysis)  \n[Manuscript](/research-project-template/manuscript)  \n[Markdown](/research-project-template/markdown)  \n[Latex](/research-project-template/latex)  \n[If Your Collaborators Use Word](/research-project-template/need-word)  \n[Your Own Reproducible Research Prject](on-your-own)  \n[Download Repository\nContents](https://github.com/mindymallory/research-project-template/tree/master)\n\nOn Your Own\n-----------\n\nOnce you understand how all the peices fit together you can modify these\nfiles to conduct your own reproducable project. Just make sure your\n`data-raw` is accessed by your analysis scripts and that your results\nare stored in the `anlaysis-output` folder. Then make sure your\nmanuscript pulls the data and analysis results automatically.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nI became interested in reproducible research because I was tired of\nbeing terrified of my own analysis. I was constantly petrified someone\nwould question my work and ask me to open the black box and verify what\nI did was correct; in some cases even being asked reproduce a result was\nterrifying because I knew the convoluted path of data prep and cleaning\nthat I took in arriving at my result.\n\nI read the book [Reproducable Research with R and\nRStudio](http://www.amazon.com/Reproducible-Research-Studio-Chapman-Hall/dp/1466572841)\nby Christopher Gandrud (2013), and I read a lot of blog posts and\ntutorials by [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/pages/software.html) and\n[Carl\nBoettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/06/research-workflow.html)\nand I struck out on my own path to execute a reproducible research\nproject from start to finish. The repository for that project is\n[here](https://github.com/mindymallory/BBOBAS), while I was successful\nin learning the basics of how r, rmarkdown, knitr, and pandoc combine to\nmake reproducible research possible, you can tell just by looking at the\nproject's Github repository that I failed miserably at making the\nproject reproducible. This is because the repository is totally\nunorganized, and I am pretty sure I am the only one who could reproduce\nthe results from this project.\n\nBut in that failure, I learned a lot about how a reproducible research\nproject should be organized. I built this template for my future\nstudents and for my future self.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nGandrud, Christopher. 2013. *Reproducible Research with R and R Studio*.\nCRC Press.\n",
