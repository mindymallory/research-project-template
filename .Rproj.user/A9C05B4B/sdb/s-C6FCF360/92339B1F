I was constantly petrified someone\nwould question my work and ask me to open the black box and verify what\nI did was correct; in some cases even being asked reproduce a result was\nterrifying because I knew the convoluted path of data prep and cleaning\nthat I took in arriving at my result.\n\nI read the book [Reproducable Research with R and\nRStudio](http://www.amazon.com/Reproducible-Research-Studio-Chapman-Hall/dp/1466572841)\nby Christopher Gandrud (2013), and I read a lot of blog posts and\ntutorials by [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/pages/software.html) and\n[Carl\nBoettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/06/research-workflow.html)\nand I struck out on my own path to execute a reproducible research\nproject from start to finish. The repository for that project is\n[here](https://github.com/mindymallory/BBOBAS), while I was successful\nin learning the basics of how r, rmarkdown, knitr, and pandoc combine to\nmake reproducible research possible, you can tell just by looking at the\nproject's Github repository that I failed miserably at making the\nproject reproducible. This is because the repository is totally\nunorganized, and I am pretty sure I am the only one who could reproduce\nthe results from this project.\n\nBut in that failure, I learned a lot about how a reproducible research\nproject should be organized. I built this template for my future\nstudents and for my future self.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nGandrud, Christopher. 2013. *Reproducible Research with R and R Studio*.\nCRC Press.\n",
